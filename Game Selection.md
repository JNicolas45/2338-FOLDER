I rate this game a 3.9/5 Over the years the developers have updated the game with collaboration events, new free weapons, new jumpsuits or cosmetics, new DLC which is better than the main story and more which made the game even more better than before. 

## Summary

 In a closed-off island pestered with a zombie infection, you play as Crane a person working for a secret organization sent off as an undercover agent to recover important files somewhere in the city. You are tasked by NPCs to fetch stuff they need or be done and in return, you get XP or valuable items. The main Antagonist is Kadir Suleiman who constantly reminds the player that "EVERYTHING WE DO IS WHAT A MAN DOES" you'll hear nothing but "This is how a man does things". Every encounter. You meet other characters as well such as Jade Aldemir who suddenly hates and blames you for the death of her brother, she dies later on literally saving your ass, but most importantly you'll meet Rahim Aldermir who teaches you the most important thing to survive and that is Parkour however he also dies later on down the road.
 
In the game, you are also introduced to infected types such as the infamous Volatiles who appear only at night and if spotted for even a millisecond by these things your goose is cooked unless you kill them or run to UV light safe zones. The game also explains the infected are more dangerous at night as creatures linger in the darkness. You eventually do Kaidir's dirty work to hopefully get him to tolerate you more but sadly what you've ended up doing was making the lives of people around you even worse but it's required to gain his trust even if he doesn't help you find the missing files as promised. As you venture into this zombie-infested nation you'll level up getting new skills to help you survive out there you'll even be granted recipes that allow you to craft weapons, ammo and weapon mods to help you survive.
 
Finally, after putting up with you after failing to kill you on several occasions even stealing the crucial files from a doctor Kadir attempts to leave the island but challenges you to a duel on top of a high tower before he can leave, after venturing up there you eventually kill him. However, in the end, the organization that you've been working for ONLY wanted you there to retrieve the cure for themselves as they could care less about your safety. You then decline to furtherly help the people of the island and that's it. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall the story was a pile of cliche garbage as you already know whats going to happen. The game itself is very clunky at first especially the parkour system but you'll get used to it. The game really took inspiration from Dead Island as it's literally the exact same thing just major changes here in there. You're going to suck and feel discouraged when you first start the game because it is unfair as your weapons will break faster or that you'll always be out of stamina/breathe but as you level up you'll soon see how much of a cakewalk it truly is. The reason I and my team chose Dying Light was that we all have preferred systems we like to play on that being Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC. Each game runs differently on different platforms therefore we will all have a different experience of things.  I like to top this off and say the developers behind Dying Light LOVE to update this game and that's pure dedication right there, they even had a marriage proposal in-game, and even a tribute to George Romero himself in-game.

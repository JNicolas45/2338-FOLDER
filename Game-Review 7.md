## Summary
Fallout 4, the 5th major installment of the franchise set in post-apocalyptic Boston Massessechusets. 210 years ago you were supposed to give a war speech about "War Never Changes" and you monologue before playing. You are to select either male or female and customize their looks before playing the game. Once done a certain individual from Vault Tech wants to validate a few things in case of an "Atomic Annihilation", here is where you'll name your character and assign perk points. Once done you watch the news hearing how bombs are flying everywhere and soon near you. Afterward, you and your family rush into the nearest Vault, Vault 111. After being told "Everything's going to be okay" the staff cryofreeze you and your family telling you its just another safety procedure. Midway your unfrozen by a mysterious figure who proceeds to kill your wife or husband and takes your kid only to refreeze you. 210 years pass by and you're unfrozen by a malfunctioning computer, you explore the vault to find out everyone except you is dead, along the way you are told how to fire your gun, use a weapon in combat, healing and the stealth mechanics.

You retrieve a PIP-BOY device and you finally ascend. From here you could just free roam and start your journey however you wish but you are prompted to go back to your house for some clues only to find your robot butler Codsworth. He too is shocked that everyone is gone but is ecstatic to finally see you again. He agrees to help find your son and you are introduced to the companion mechanic. After leaving your neighborhood you meet Dogmeat a friendly dog who is now your best friend. You return Codsworth to your house since you cannot have more than 1 companion. You make your way to a museum but a group of people led by Preston Garvey is attacked by Raiders. After getting introduced to power armor and defeating a mighty Deathclaw you lead them back to your old town and you are introduced to the settlement mechanic where you have to maintain food, water, defenses and build beds to keep your settlement happy. You are also indoctrinated as the Minutemen General thus introduced to the helping settlement mechanics where if you help a settlement they in-return will help you in combat along the way along with revealing new land and new settlement locations.

After that, you make your way to Diamond City and are introduced to Piper and The Mayor who constantly fight. After talking down the mayor he reveals you can find more help by locating Nick Valentine at Nick's Detective Agency. You can have Piper replace Dogmeat here if you wish. Nick's assistant tells you he was investing a case but never came back so it's up to you to rescue him. After locating the underground Vault and killing everyone in your wake you finally find and free Nick who then tells you when you try to leave the big cheese isn't going to be happy. After getting out you are greeted by the big cheese Skinny Malone but a charisma check makes his girlfriend leave upsetting him and giving you a chance to leave thus letting you leave without killing everyone. After that Nick thanks you and tells you to meet him at your office at which you then discover the identity of the man who killed your husband or wife and stole your child, Kellog. You investigate a house he previously was hold up in and find a clue. You then bring in Dogmeat to get his scent and the chase is on.

Nick tells you good luck but says it ain't going to be pretty. After finding numerous clues you finally find Kellog's hideout, after battling a new enemy and faction aka The Synth you find Kellog and he tells you everything he did, he was just following orders. You cannot talk your way out of this as he gives you all the answers you ever wanted to know but eventually you kill him and his synth guards only to find out he too was a synth. You take a few pieces of his robotic brain just in case. When exiting out of the Fort the Brotherhood of Steel's mother ship the Pruden arrives telling all BOS units to meet up at the airport. IF you already met up with Paladin Dance and his crew then you should proceed as another faction joins in on the fun the Brotherhood Of Steel. After returning to Nick he then tells you someone can furtherly help, a doctor in Good Neighbor. After tracking her down and showing her the brain pieces she agrees to help you. 

After literally traversing Kellogs' mind it's revealed he gave your son to the Synth who uses teleportation to get in or out of the place. However she tells you another group can furtherly encrypt the signal, she tells you to "To follow the trail". This means following those red brick lines you've been seeing around the place which eventually leads you to a church that has an underground system. You are stopped by a wheel and you must figure out how to open it, it's revealed the password was "RAILROAD" and you are greeted by yet again another faction, the secret "Underground Railroad" who believe all Synths should have a freedom of choice instead of being programmed to follow orders. Desdemona the leader demands how you got inside and you tell her you've followed the trail but she keeps questioning you as she wants to know who told you, we're here, did you get followed, and why come to the base. After telling her Doctor Amari helped you out she agrees to help you as well as long as you don't do anything fishy. Tom the hacker gets to work and gets it done. It is where you're told to find Virgil the man who escaped the Institute and lived to tell the tale, however, he's located somewhere in the Red Sea a dangerous place where the initial bombs fell. It's also here where you can do sidequests with the Railroad and fully be trusted. You manage to find Virgil and he explains how he escaped and why.

He then tells you that you must find and kill a Courser and get its wave signals as it's key to teleporting to the Institute. You eventually find and kill one and after going back to Virgil he tells you to give it to a faction to build the teleporter device, Brotherhood of Steel, The Underground Railroad or The Minutemen. After selecting a faction to do so you finally get inside but truth be told "Father" is your son. It is here where you'll find your answers but if you decide not to side with your son you'll be escorted out but you'll remain an enemy of the Institute. It's revealed Shawn doesn't care about you or your wife/husband unless you side with him only then will he reveal how he missed you but only IF you side with him. When you come out you have 3 paths, Tell the Brotherhood and they'll start you on a quest to build the fan-favorite LIBERTY PRIME robot and destroy the place, Tell the Railroad and going undercover to get as many Synths as you can out before you raid the place or The Minutemen as a neutral option. However, depending on which faction you side with it can change the story. If Brotherhood is chosen not only will you get to build LIBERTY PRIME but you'll also get the chance to eliminate the Underground Railroad as the Brotherhood hates synths and others who associate with them, however, you can warn the Underground Railroad to fail the assault on purpose but Elder Maxson will not be pleased. It's here whereas the Railroad you can start the questlines to blow up the Pruden airship. As with my first Playthrough immediately went with building Liberty Prime because his dialogue is just hilarious. After choosing a faction you eventually raid the Institute and have a moment with your dying son. If allied with the institute and doing their entire questline he says it was a joy seeing his mom or dad again and that he's glad to work with them, if not he tells you simply that he would like to sleep. After escaping the blast from the base you are teleported to a tower, it is here where you can finish it by blowing up the whole place unless your the Brotherhood and destroyed the place by other means. You complete the game and are greeted by a monologue from your character saying this isn't the world you wanted but your now in it and living the best you could, War Never Changes.   


## Final Thoughts
The dialogue the game offers wasn't good as it was from the creators or writers from Obsidian however the DLC storylines from Far Harbor and Automatron will somewhat change that. While the game did age it's the modding community that keeps the game going as on NEXUS MODS there's plenty of stuff to download to enhance the gameplay ie new weapons, characters, custom stories, armor mods and more. What I didn't like was the settlement management, you could be doing an important quest and your settlement will be attacked regardless of how high your defense numbers are and if you don't help your settlement guarded by the best turrents will oddly be destroyed which is frustrating but Preston Garvey constantly telling you "A settlement needs your help, I'll mark it on your map." 24/7 is beyond infuriating. What I did love besides finding the other Vaults and discovering sinister secrets that lie within each vault was the replayability the game has to offer even with the mentioned DLC. You can play and achieve different questlines depending on your choices you make throughout the game and make builds accordingly as many Youtubers have jokingly done. The Legendary Weapons just feel like ordinary weapons there's nothing really special about them, just another weapon in the wasteland. Even a boxing glove that cripples and staggers targets on hit is silly but it's not impressive that is until you get to Far Harbor where Legendary weapons feel unique. Like I said before the mods on NEXUS MODS keep the game going with vast improvements on the game. I liked the companion system but only having 1 companion instead of the intended 2 is just lame however customizing their gear is impressive except Paladin Danse as you cannot give him anything but with Codsworth being a robot you can customize what hats he can wear and dogmeat can be customized to wear bandanas, goggles, and armor.

The personal companion quests give depth to your companions and I love hearing how they came to be or how they came to Boston such as Cait being a drug addict in which you help her overcome her addiction and that she wants to repay someday for helping her out, finding out Danse is a Synth and you spare him to defy Elder Maxson, or Nick Valentine appreciating you helping him on his cases even if he doesn't want to admit it, etc. I enjoyed playing Fallout 4 but overall while the story and the plain dialogue won't grip you the DLC and content from NEXUX MODS will certainly keep you entertained for ages along with the replayability Fallout 4 has to offer. Like Skyrim, Fallout 4 is a game worth playing for years to come.

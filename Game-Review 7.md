## Summary

Fallout 4, the 5th major installment of the franchise set in post apacolipctic Boston Massessechusets. 210 years ago you were supposed to give a war speech about "War Never Changes" and you monologue before playing. You are to select either male or female and customize their looks before playing the game. Once done a certain individial from Vault Tech wants to vailidate a few things in case of a "Atomic Ahnilition", here is where you'll name your character and assign perk points. Once done you watch the news hearing how there's bombs flying everywhere and soon near you. Afterwards you and your family rush in to the nearest Vault, Vault 111. After being told "Everything's going to be okay" the staff cryofreeze you and your family telling you its just another safety procedure. Midway your unfrozen by a mysterious figure who proceeds to kill your wife or husband and takes your kid only to refreeze you. 210 years pass by and your unfrozen by a malfunctioning computer, you explore the vault to find out everyone except you is dead, along the way you are told how to fire your gun, use a weapon in combat, healing and the stealth mechanics. You retrieve your own PITBOY device and you finally ascend. From here you could just free roam and start your journey however you wish but you are promted to go back to your house for some clues only to find your robot butler Codsworth. He too is shocked that everyone is gone but is estatic to finally see you again. He agrees to help find your son and you are introduced to the companion mechanic. After leaving your neighborhood you meet Dogmeat a friendly dog whom is now your best friend. You return codsworth back to your house since you cannot have more than 1 companion. You make your way to a museum but a group of people led by Preston Garvey are attcked by Bandits. After getting introduced to power armor and defeating a mighty Deathclaw you lead them back to your old town and you are introduced to the settlement mechanic where you have to maintain food, water, defenses and build beds to keep your settlement happy. You are also indoctrinated as the Minutemen General thus introduced to the helping settlement mechanics where if you help a settlement they in-return will help you in combat along the way along with revealing new land and new settlement locations. After that you make your way to Diamond City and are introduced to Piper and The Mayor who constantly fight. After talking down the mayor he reveals you can find more help by locating Nick Valentine at Nick's Detective Agency. You can have Piper replace Dogmeat here if you wish. Nicks assitant tells you he was investing a case but never came back so its up to you to rescue him. After locating the underground Vault and killing everyone in your wake you finally find and free Nick who then tells you when you try to leave the big cheese isn't going to be happy. After getting out you are greeted by the big cheese Skinny Malone but a charaisma check makes his girlfriend leave upsetting him and giving you a chance to leave thus letting you leave without killing everyone. After that Nick thanks you and tells you to meet him at your office at which you then discover the identtiy of the man who killed your husband or wife and stole your child, Kellog. You investigate a house he previously was hold up in and find a clue. You then bring in Dogmeat to get his scent and the chase is on. Nick tells you good luck but says it ain't going to be pretty. After finding numerous of clues you finally find Kellog's hideout, after battling a new enemy and faction aka The Synth you find Kellog and he tells you everything he did, he was just following orders. You cannot talk your way out of this as he gives you all the answers you every wanted to know but eventually you kill him and his synth guards only to find out he too was a synth. You take a few pieces of his robotic brain just in case. When exting out of the Fort the Brotherhood of Steel's mother ship the Pruden arrives telling all BOS units to meet up at the airport. IF you already met up with Paladin Dance and his crew then you should proceed as another faction joins in on the fun the Brotherhood Of Steel. After returning to Nick he then tells you someome can furtherly help, a doctor in Good Neighbor. After trecking her down and showing her the brain pieces she agrees to help you. After literally traversing Kellogs mind it's revealed he gave your son to the Synth who uses teleportation to get in or out of the place. However she tells you another group can furtherly encrypt the signal, she tells you to "To follow the trail". This means follwing those red brick lines you've been seeing around the place which eventually leads you to a church which has an underground system. You are stopped by a wheel and you must figure out how to open it, it's revealed the password was "RAILROAD" and you are greeted by yet again another faction, the secret "Underground Railroad" who beleive all Synths should have a freedom of choice instead of being programmed to follow orders. Desdemona the leader demands how you got inside and you tell her you've followed the trail but she keeps questioning you as she wants to know who told you, why're here, did you get followed, and why come to the base. After telling her Doctor Amari helped you out she agrees to help you as well as long as you don't do anything fishy. Tom the hacker gets to work and gets it done. It is here you're told to find Virgil the man who espaped the Institute and lived to tell the tale, however hes located somewhere in the Red Sea a dangerous place where the inital bombs fell. It's also here where you can do sidequests with the Railroad and fully be trusted ## Final Thoughts

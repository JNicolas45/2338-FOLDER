## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (√) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | On PC (DELL G3 17) when player loads in-game sometimes everything is low poly, and sometimes will remain that way even if player is playing on High settings.| When loading everything should be good to go and no low-poly textures should pop up. | Upon loading on High settings everything loaded in with no low-poly textures however this bug/issue is reoccuring and can be seemingly fixed by either resetting your settings or by patiently waiting in-game for everything to load properly.|			
| 2 | Volatiles will still follow the player even through Ultra Violet lit areas to which the AI should be commited to stop and run away as their not supposed to stay in Ultra Violet areas.| When being chased and upon reaching an Ultra Violet lit area the AI for the Volatiles should NOT be running into said safe lit areas. | Upon numerous tests, Volatiles will briefly stay in the lit areas but would run away seconds later. In honesty the only "fix" i've found was just to wait around the ultra violet lit areas until they ran away.
| 3 | For PC sometimes when loading the game the sound would be non existent breifly especially for Co-op but will come back on seconds later. | Expected result is when the player loads the game for single or co-op modes the sounds should be working and no other sound problems should continue.| After numerous of tests it appears to happen frequenly even on high settings but the sound returns seconds later. A solution that i found was messing with the audio settings by returning them to default then proceeding to resume the game or by reloading my game and play a game of chance hoping it'd be back to normal which it nomrally would.|			
| 4 |On PC whenever I would close the game and would play the game again minutes later I sometimes would get an error saying "DYING LIGHT NOT RESPONDING" or "DYING LIGHT IS ALREADY RUNNING". | Expected result being whenever i open the game i shouldn't get any errors and the game should be running as intended. | This happens frequently if within seconds i close the game and re-open it. This is fixed by running the game as administrator or by verifying integrity of game files in the local files tab when you right click on the game in your steam library > local files then the tab should be on the bottom.|			
| 5 | On PC whenever playing Co-op me or my partner's model is bugged, sometimes whenever a friend would join and load in or vice verssa our character model is loaded in but not our head as it looks like someome cut off our head.| Expected result being whenever me or a friend would load our character models should load fully.| Upon loading in to a friends game several times we've seen the problem persist but not as often as we thought. The solution that i found was to exit the game then re-enter.|			
| 6 |A hilarious bug found by me and a friend is whenever you see a group of survivors together at a table and decide to jump on top of them, you'll be seen floating around as if you're still falling until you both exit out of the room.| Hiliarious as that is we expect that whenever a player decides to jump on top of a group this sillyness doesn't occur.| Upon testing 4 times (Reloading our game each time) before me and a friend gave up from laughter it is indeed re-occuring and i don't think it'll be fixed anytime soon.|			
| 7 |When playing co-op and your partner enters a cinematic cutscene for securing a safe zone sometimes your partner will be nowhere to be seen even though you can see their name as if they're invisible.| Expected result being in co-op whenever me or a friend get into a cutscene we should be able to see each other's character. | Funny enough the only solution is to let the cutscene go through then you or your partner will be visible. This happened quite often but not to the point where it was game breaking.|			
| 8 |An interesting "bug" or issue is whenever the player would slide continuously off of things, from their partner's point of view it'll look like your just sliding everywhere without getting up so animation canceling probably?| Expected result being whenever a player would slide off of things we should be able to see an animation of them getting up.| Funny enough the result is what we expected, rather than seeing a "Getting up" animation all me and my friend see is us sliding around everywhere. The only "Fix" was to slide on the ground instead of on top of cars, barriers or other things. |			
| 9 | There is a "Solo duplication glitch" which takes the fun out of the game and works on stackable items meaning to say all items present in the game. And surprisingly it still works till this day but only on PC as of now. | Expected result being i myself will try the duplication glitch to see if it still works just like Dead Island.| The test was successful as i've duplicated much needed items such as flares. Overall just a really cheap way to stack items for whatever the player needs.|			
| 10 | When a quest is completed and you goto the NPC that gave you the quest sometimes you won't be promt to press a button to speak to them thus haulting any progression with that NPC.| Expected result being whenever the player completes a quest, the player should be promt to talk the NPC with no proble.| Result being this didn't happen frequently, i simply fixed it by reloading my game.|			

## Overall Test Status:



## Run History:
| # |	Run Date |	Run By |	Results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Me (Justus) playing on PC i've listed as mentioned 10 bugs/issues that i've found from April 1st-May 1st | The tests conducted were by me and my Steam pals. | Most bugs we've encountered were just silly and hardly game breaking with the exception of the solo duplication glitch? Meanwhile some did get me frustrated as i was looking for a workaround that didn't involve in me restarting my computer. There were also other bugs/issues that were encountered as well that i haven't listed above but i've placed these under the "common" ones we've encountered. Finally to conclude most issues were fixed out of my frustration to find a fix for them by simply restarting my pc completely or reloading my current game. |

Instead of a continuation after the events of EBF4 it's more of reboot before the heroes met. 

## Final Thoughts

With all the updates, bug fixes and friendly community interactions by Matt Roszak (Discord, Facebook, Kupogames website and on Matt's Steam Developer page) this game is really fun to play and is worth the money. When it first released yeah sure it had serious problems but over time they were fixed. Like previous games, EPIC difficulty gives you medals for bragging rights and is the definition of "Difficulty and Challenge" as most places especially in the dungeon challenge areas and boss rush demand you know what to use. In my case, I at first DIDN'T enjoy EPIC DIFFICULTY because I disliked how most of these bosses in the battle dungeons or hidden areas were beating my ass effortlessly or when at a certain HP threshold they'd completely change their tactics and destroy me or kill me with something else resulting in me constantly reviving my team and barely having time to do damage (Example being the hidden arcade bosses you can find and go against.)  But that's one of the main points of this game that I love, it'll hold your hand for a bit sure but personally no game is fun without "Difficulty and Challenge" and the rewards you get for doing so. Overall it's a very fun game, it makes players think twice about what to use, the environments are stunning to look at, the character banter throughout the game is memorable, the animations are nice to look at as the same can be said about the gear you can acquire, you can see the level of detail and thought put into the game and don't forget the beautiful soundtrack. I highly recommend this game and the price isn't blowing a hole in your wallet to justify it as it's just 20 bucks.

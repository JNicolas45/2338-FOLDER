## Summary

Instead of a continuation after the events of EBF4, it's more of a reboot. We start the game with the tank of the group, Matt. He sets off on an arduous adventure after a meteor crash-landed and turned off the power just before he could beat a game he was playing. He decides to explore and you're given through funny dialogue by Matt on what his skills do (Matt has the highest PHYSICAL DEFENCE of the party as he IS a tank with good power overall focusing on single target attacks.) and you come across No Legs a nimble but deadly cat who after beating to a pulp joins the group. (No Legs has the highest haste stat in the party at the cost of low HP, he's more of a support but can still kick ass while dodging a majority of attacks going his way.) After learning the game's mechanics especially the "Capture" feature we are confronted by Anna who thinks this was all caused by Matt and No Legs because of the monsters they've killed. She's a speedy person but you eventually beat her and she joins the group. After the two explain to her what happened, she joins as she too wants to know what happened out there. (Anna is a mix barrage as evident by how her stats are evenly distrubuted.) After getting information about Cosmic Monoliths they see that the river is being polluted in the distance, after getting closer to a fortress they meet Natalie the group's main mage and fan service of the series whose kidnapped by Lance because he wants a girlfriend for "other" research purposes. After basically vandalizing Lance's fortress and freeing his prisoners you finally get to fight him, he eventually loses and joins the group for "Redemption" at the request of Anna which also makes Natalie join the group as well. (Lance is a heavy magic user though to beat magic resistant enemies hes also a good fighter with nice physical attack. Meanwhile Natelie being the mage of the group has the highest MAGIC ATTACK and MAGIC DEFENSE stat in the party but will suffer horribly from physical attacks and does not want to physically attack with her weapon unless she has to.) Afterward, you traverse through an ice temple only to be confronted by Poseidon who hates humans because they polluted the river. You defeat him and move on to find Redpine the village that got hit by the meteor. You eventually find more Cosmic Monoliths just outside the village but you defeat them and enter the "The Rapture". You are not alone as the NPC's whom you've helped along the way give you much-needed items to help you on your final journey. After traversing The Rapture you enter "The Beyond". After breaking the fourth wall and recognizing that YOU the player influences them and their actions you finally meet "The Devourer" who explains to his frustration that the previous Epic Battle Fantasy games are simulations and that you ALWAYS ruin his plans ie defeating the final bosses of each respective games. He also reveals in this simulation he removed the parties' memories of their previous exploits which explains when they meet a familiar foe they say along the lines of "Hey, I slightly remember this foe but don't know where though?" After defeating his various forms he pledges he'll be back but somewhere where the party cannot reach him and a cutscene plays which so happens to start Newgame+ to relive the events once more. There are also optional dungeons that hold vast amounts of treasures which also house badass bosses that the party can capture but scale to the parties' level along with hard puzzles but again with rewarding treasures. There is also seasonal event quests which can be completed to seasonal event rewards.

## Final Thoughts

With all the updates, bug fixes and friendly community interactions by Matt Roszak (Discord, Facebook, Kupogames website and on Matt's Steam Developer page) this game is really fun to play and is worth the money. When it first released yeah sure it had serious problems but over time they were fixed. Like previous games, EPIC difficulty gives you medals for bragging rights and is the definition of "Difficulty and Challenge" as most places especially in the dungeon challenge areas and boss rush demand you know what to use. In my case, I at first DIDN'T enjoy EPIC DIFFICULTY because I disliked how most of these bosses in the battle dungeons or hidden areas were beating my ass effortlessly or when at a certain HP threshold they'd completely change their tactics and destroy me or kill me with something else resulting in me constantly reviving my team and barely having time to do damage (Example being the hidden arcade bosses you can find and go against.)  But that's one of the main points of this game that I love, it'll hold your hand for a bit sure but personally no game is fun without "Difficulty and Challenge" and the rewards you get for doing so. Overall it's a very fun game, it makes players think twice about what to use, the environments are stunning to look at, the character banter throughout the game is memorable, the animations are nice to look at as the same can be said about the gear you can acquire, you can see the level of detail and thought put into the game and don't forget the beautiful soundtrack. I highly recommend this game and the price isn't blowing a hole in your wallet to justify it as it's just 20 bucks or you can play for free on Newgrounds but you won't get the additional challenge dungeons as that's specifcally for the Steam version. Throughout the game you can also scan enemies to see their weaknesses making you equip things that'll hit'em hard as well as wearing specific armor that'll give you resistance to their attacks.

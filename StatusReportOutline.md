# Project Schedule

We will discuss what we've found during our playthroughs and share some issues/bugs we've each found. Then we'll compare our findings to see if those said bugs/issues persist not only on our device of choice. After which we'll discuss how we found the problem/bug, how we attempted to fix it, and how often it keeps occurring during our playthroughs. Afterward, we'll discuss what if anything could be removed to make the game better in our opinion.

# Current Schedule

I Justus (PC) will discuss what I've found with the team and see if they too encountered it or something similar, how I fixed the issue/bug, agree whether or not it's a reoccurring thing with my team and finally see if it's worse on consoles or if my findings are just for the PC version only. Angel (Xbox One) will discuss his findings, how he got them to occur, how did he fix them, and finally his thoughts on what should be removed or upgraded to improve the game. Then finally Matthew (Playstation 4) will do the same. As a final note, we will discuss what bug we all encountered to see if we can find a solution to it and to agree on what could be improved or removed to make the game more enjoyable.

# General Notes/Overall Status

Overall as a team, we can safely say while the game is old it still has bugs even if some are just wacky. It was also good to know that many bugs reside in other platforms as well so we can all float on the same boat of frustration or laughter. We also discussed what should be removed or improved to make the game more fun. Finally, we discussed if the problems/bugs we've encountered are game-breaking or trivial. While we've argued what should be kept or improved in the game, In the end, we enjoyed searching for bugs/issues and knowing that the other platforms have the same or similar problems because a game is not always perfect.

## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (âˆš) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | On PC (DELL G3 17) when player loads in-game sometimes everything is low poly, and sometimes will remain that way if player is playing on low settings.| When loading everything should be good to go and no low-poly textures should pop up. | Upon loading on low settings everything loaded in with no low-poly textures however this bug/issue is reoccuring and can be seemingly fixed by either resetting your settings or by patiently waiting in-game for everything to load properly.|			
| 2 | Volatiles will still follow the player even through Ultra Violet lit areas to which the AI should be commited to stop and run away as their not supposed to stay in Ultra Violet areas.| When being chased and upon reaching an Ultra Violet lit area the AI for the Volatiles should be running away instead of staying in the area. | Upon numerous tests Volatiles will breifly stay in the lit areas but would run away seconds later. I've encountered this big frequently. The fix to this was reloading my game or waiting till the AI actually finds out its not supposed to be there and run away. 
| 3 | For PC sometimes when loading the game the sound would be non existent breifly especially for Co-op but will come back on seconds later. | Expected result is when the player loads the game for single or co-op the sounds should be working and no other sound problems should continue.| After numerous of tests it appears to happen frequenly even on high settings but the sound returns seconds later. A solution that i found was messing with the audio settings by returning them to default then proceeding to resume the game.|			
| 4 | On PC whenever i would close the game and would play the game again minutes later i sometimes would get an error saying "DYLING LIGHT NOT RESPONDING" or "DYLING LIGHT IS ALREADY RUNNING". | Expected result being whenever i open the game i shouldn't get any errors and the game should be running as intended. | This happens frequently if within seconds i close the game and re-open it. This is fixed by running the game as administrator or by verifying integrity of game files in the local files tab when you right click on the game in your steam library > local files then the tab should be on the bottom.|			
| 5 | On PC whenever playing Co-op me or my partner's model is bugged, sometimes whenever a friend would join and load in or vice verssa our character model is loaded in but not our head as it looks like someome cut off our head.| Expected result being whenever me or a friend would load our character models should load fully.| Upon loading in to a friends game several times we've seen the problem persist but not as often as we thought. The solution that i found was to exit the game then re-enter.|			
| 6 | A hiliarous bug found be me and a friend is whenever you see a group of survivors together at a table and decide to jump on top of them, you'll be seen floating around as if your still falling until you both exit out of the room.| Hiliarious as that is we expect that whenever a player decides to jump on top of a group this sillyness doesn't occur.| Upon testing 4 times (Reloading our game each time) before me and a friend gave up from laughter it is indeed re-occuring and i don't think it'll be fixed anytime soon.|			
| 7 | When playing co-op and your partner enters a cinamatic cutscene for securing a safezone sometimes your partner will be nowhere to be seen even though you can clearly see their name as if their invisible.| Expected result being in co-op whenever me or a friend get into a cutscene we should be able to see each other's character. | Funny enough the only solution is to let the cutscene go through then you or your parter will be visible. This happened quite often but not to the point where it was game breaking.|			
| 8 | An interresting "bug" or issue is whenever the player would slide continuously off of things, from their parters point of view it'll look like your just sliding everywhere without getting up so animation canceling problably?| Expected result being whenever a player would slide off of things we should be able to see an animation of them getting up.| Funny enough the result is what we expected, rather than seeing a "Getting up" animation all me and my friend see is us sliding around everywhere. The only "Fix" was to slide on the ground instead of on top of cars, barriers or other things. |			
| 9 | There is a "Solo duplication glitch" to which takes the fun out of the game and works on stackable items meaning to say all items present in the game. And surpirsingly it still works till this day but only on PC as of now. | Expected result being i myself will try the duplication glitch to see if it still works just like Dead Island.| The test was successful as i've duplicated much needed items such as flares. Overall just a really cheap way to stack items for whatever the player needs.|

| 1 | Me (Justus) playing on PC i've listed as mentioned 10 bugs/issues that i've found from April 1st-May 1st | The tests conducted were by me and my Steam pals. | Most bugs we've encountered were just silly and hardly game breaking with the exception of the solo duplication glitch? As only a few made me infuriated. There were also other bugs/issues that were encountered as well. |

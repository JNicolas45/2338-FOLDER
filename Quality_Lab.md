Game 1: Dying Light
- Even though the game is old it still has tons of replayabilty, its flexiable as you can play the game on consoles or PC even smaller devices such as the PSP, 2DS and for mobile. It has mechanics that make it stand out to other zombie games such as parkour, easter eggs  paying homage to other games especially to George Romero, even now the developers are still updating the game with weapon or collaboration events such as Dying LightxL4D. Mod support is always there for PC games. 

Game 2: Garry's Mod
- A timeless classic, even though its older than the majority of its player base it's still being suported via steam workshop mods, while graphics are low it depends on what assets you port into your session, tons of replayability as like Minecraft the whole sandbox level is your oyster. Always on sale so it's always available for cheap. It's also where people practice first before trying out Source Film Maker for trying animation movies or shorts. 

Game 3: Call of Duty Zombies 
- Another classic game mode going back to World at War, in each Call of Duty game the Zombies game mode adds new maps meaning the environment looks fresh no matter the maps even the remastered maps which add nolsatolgia, new/returning weapons, easter egg/story rewards, new characters, new hazards to adapt or die to, the option to play it on consoles or PC, mechanics aren't too hard to learn even with the new COD's, each map includes new enemies to add difficulty and challenge.

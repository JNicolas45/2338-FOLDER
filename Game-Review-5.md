## Summary

Jetpack Joyride, you play as Barry Steakfries a man outta luck who stumbles upon a secret underground laboratory who then proceeds to take their experimental jetpacks on a "Jetpack Joyride". An exhilarating sidescroller game as your main objective is to go as far as possible while avoiding lasers that'll change their pattern every confrontation along with avoiding speedy missiles. The farther you go the faster the missiles and lasers will appear along with even more complicated laser patterns and faster missiles you have to dodge. Along the way you acquire gold to purchase major goodies such as gadgets to help you on your runs, cosmetics to flex, and different vehicle costumes to purchase for the 4 possible vehicles that you can get your hands on while playing. The vehicles you can collect are the following that slow downtime for a bit once collected: The Lil Stomper a mini mech in which you can float in the air but only for a limited time, Mr.Cuddles a dragon robot that spews fire and can weave up/down to collect tons of coins, The Gravity suit which allows the player to switch gravity and run on the ceiling/vice versa, Bad-As-Hog a chopper that goes incredibly fast and can jump great heights, the Crazy Teleporter which as the name implies allows you to teleport anywhere on the screen, the Jet-Ski which allows you to ride the waves, the Robot Bird which is a really nice homage to Flappy Bird and finally the S.A.M which you get by collecting the 3 letters that pop up randomly during your runs. The S.A.M is a fast behemoth of a mech while piloting it not only do you go faster every second but you also have to deflect missiles that come your way, 3 hits and your out. Unfortunately, the other vehicles are destroyed with a simple hit of a laser or missile. Collect and use the SAM every day and you can get weekly rewards such as new cosmetics or a new Jetpack. There are over 20 jetpacks each with a special flair such as the Teddy Bear Jetpack instead of bullets or bubbles as you ascend you'll see hearts instead. There's even more with seasonal and limited timed events though these can remain permanent if you simply play offline. My personal favorite was the Back To The Future anniversary event which allowed you to obtain cosmetics and gear from the Back To The Future movies. Once you get hit by a laser or missile you can spin a slot machine with various prizes such being a second chance, more gold or an explosive boost which drops 1 out of 3 bombs on you giving you an extra push to increase your final distance. You can also get more goodies by watching ads. Finally, there are missions the player can complete to earn more rewards however every 15 levels you can choose to "Rank up" which gives you a badge and even more missions or you can decline and play without missions.

## Final Thoughts

While the game is surely outdated it's still being supported by updates here and there that grant even more cosmetics and jetpacks to purchase giving players a means to keep on returning. What I love is that every Jetpack is unique and that not all are the same, there are even sales on certain Jetpacks the player can get what they've been saving for. The most positive thing about Jetpack Joyride is the fact that while it is originally a mobile game you'd expect "BUY THIS!!!" to be slapping you constantly but that's not the case as the game gives you a preview of bundles you can buy and you no longer see said bundles until you visit the store. Very refreshing from having to spend money even on the littlest of things.  I dislike how while you go faster as you go the missiles and laser pathways can be unfair as the missiles have 3 routes/ways to hit you either by single missile, by group of missiles or pathway missiles that you must dodge one by one, it tends to make you dodge one then immediately within split seconds dodge another one while avoiding lasers that obscure your path thus killing you if you don't have fast reflexes. A final dislike is that you can only get the SAM once a day so if you screwed up and got hit 3 times way too early while in the SAM, tough luck chum and that's rather frustrating. Halfbrick also makes silly animations for this game on their Youtube channel. A final note being it's one of the very few mobile games out there that actually has effort put into it.

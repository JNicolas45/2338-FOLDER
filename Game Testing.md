Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were simple enough to follow ie destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours while upgrading your units or buying new ones along with new heroes. 

Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: Yes, in the game you have units that use projecile attacks that go on forever until it hits a foe. I truly believe shorting the range  would be better as that seems fair as the AI on some levels spam units whose proejctiles can go far and seemlingly beat you especially on TRIAL stages which furtherly increases frustration. Also as a pet peeve you CANNOT get a certain HERO unless you're a Kongregate member. Either way the player isn't missing out on anything special besides a fast unit. 

Question: Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?

Answer: Yes and No. In Campaign mode obviously each map ramps up the difficulty slighty however there are maps that are seemingly impossibly which forces the player to farm other maps ot obtain more gold to upgrade or get better units. Some units are better than most units ie you can stunlock foes if you hit them first and vice versa that alone is frustrating and hardly balanced as you have a certain limit to units you can have on the field meanwhile the AI doesn't. According to the update logs updates have been made to where enemy bases aren't as spongey and those lovely gold exploits are now fixed. To help players we can get spells to aid us on our quest though really you'll only be using 3 out of 12 spells as its a no brainer that Invincibility which makes your units unkillable for a few seconds, BERZERK makes your units CRIT doing more damage, and Comet to save you in a pinch are more useful than the other 9 spells. 

Question: Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

Answer: The game was released in 2010 when Kongregate.com had many of its greatest gems released as there was a bunch of variety of games to play so yes the timing was right. 

Question: During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

Answer: Absoulutely as the game is called EPIC WAR 4, the music fits very well, the theme of the various exotic units you can unlock and go against and the bosses you go up against as well. It isn't called EPIC WAR for nothing. 

Question: Did you have fun playing this game?

Answer: Again absoulutly even after all this time the game still holds up 10 years later. Hearing the soundtrack after all this time is the icing on the cake as to me its one of the most memorable things about the game or rather for all EPIC WAR games. 

Question: During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?

Answer: The game sometimes loses your save file and makes you start all over again even if you're logged into your Kongregate account. On most maps whenever you defeat the map ie destroy the enemy base instead of telling you "YOU WIN!" the game'll just sit there for a few mins and then proceeds to the "YOU WIN!" screen. Welcomed or not i guess after all this time it still hasn't been fixed. Finally another issue with the game since it came from an earlier time is that when you press retreat or fallback units do not automatically go back they instead finish their attack animation and then fall back which causes the player to lose a majority of their units

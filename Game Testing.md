Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were simple enough to follow ie destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours while upgrading your units or buying new ones along with new heroes. 

Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: Yes, in the game you have units that use projecile attacks that go on forever until it hits a foe. I truly believe shorting the range  would be better as that seems fair as the AI on some levels spam units whose proejctiles can go far and seemlingly beat you especially on TRIAL stages which furtherly increases frustration but with hefty rewards. This is fixed in Epic War 5.

Question: Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?

Answer: Yes and No. In Campaign mode obviously each map ramps up the difficulty slighty however there are maps that are seemingly impossibly which forces the player to farm other maps to upgrade or get better units. Whenever the AI is close to losing they'll send out "Reinforcement waves" which are just alot of their units stacked and sent out. This is furtherly frustrating as some of those units are strong in numbers and can kill your units when your just inches away from claiming victory. On some maps the AI sends out EPIC TITANS which if not dealt with swiftly can cost you the game. 

Question: Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

Answer: The game was released in 2010 when Kongregate.com had many of its greatest gems released as there was a bunch of variety of games to play so yes the timing was right. 

Question: During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

Answer: Absoulutely as the game is called EPIC WAR 4, the music fits very well, the theme of the various exotic units you can unlock and go against and the bosses you go up against as well. It isn't called EPIC WAR 4 for nothing. 

Question: Did you have fun playing this game?

Answer: Again absoulutly even after all this time the game still holds up 10 years later. 

Question: During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?

Answer: The game sometimes loses your save file and makes you start all over again, this was however adressed and was fixed although sometimes it just happens. On the TRIALS maps whenever you defeat the map ie destroy the enemy base instead of telling you "YOU WIN!" the game'll just sit there for a few mins and then proceeds to the "YOU WIN!" screen. This reoccurs alot in the TRIALS maps. Welcomed or not i guess after all this time it still hasn't been fixed.

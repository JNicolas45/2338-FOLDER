# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

Me and my team have agreed to play Dying Light on systems we each prefer with mine being PC. I understand that since we all use different systems to play we may vary on the kinds of problems we may encounter. 

## Environment/User Community

Me and my team will be conducting our tests on PC (DELL G3 17), Xbox One and the Playstation 4. 

## Test Objectives

As a team since we all play on different systems we will try to encounter bugs/issues while we play the game, we will note how the bug/issue was encountered, how often it happens, how did we solve the issue, consider if the issue is re-occuring, and how to prevent future issues if possible. Finally we will discuss if our bugs/issues persist on other devices as well. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Since we all play on different systems and that problems may vary for each of us i'm thinking we should at least enocunter 10 bugs/issues as that seems like a fair amount for an old gagme constantly being backed by the community and developers. So surely there's still plent of bugs roaming around.

# Section 2: Plan
## Test Description

My and my team are looking for bugs/issues even if most are wacky, but considering this is an old game there is bound to be more than what we imagined. So for PC i'm testing AI pathfinding, the PC only duplication glitch, cinamatic cutscene bugs, Dying Light not running even though it is error on Steam, non-existent sound for a brief moment when joining a persons game, seeing if there's a possible fix for these that doesn't involve in restarting my computer and seeing if my team members found identical problems. 


## Test Team

Matthew and Angel, one is testing on the Playstation 4 and the other is testing on the Xbox One. As stated since we're playing on different devices each of us may enocunter something different that the others can't be able to find or see. 

## Milestones

* Testing Locations, events, test phases and dates of testing

## Budgets

Funds allocated to testing by task

## Testing
### Requirements

Resource requirements, equipment, software/hardware, tester with special skill set

### Testing Materials/Test Tools

On the PC i'm using notepad and stickynotes to write down any bugs/issues i've been finding if any. 

### Test Training

Personnel training, types of training/training staff - could include acceptance testing or
playtesting

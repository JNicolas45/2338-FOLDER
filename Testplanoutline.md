# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

Me and my team have agreed to play Dying Light on systems we each prefer with mine being PC. I understand that since we all use different systems we may vary on issues we encounter. 

## Environment/User Community

Me and my team will be conducting our tests on PC, Xbox and Playstation systems.

## Test Objectives

As a team since we all play on different systems we will try to encounter bugs/issues while we play the game, we will note how the bug/issue was encountered, how often it happens, how did we solve the issue, consider if the issue is re-occuring, and how to prevent future issues. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Realistically since we all play on different systems and that problems may vary for each of us i'm thinking we should at least enocunter 10 bugs/issues as that seems like a fair amount for an old gagme constantly being backed by the community and developers.

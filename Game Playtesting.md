* Question: During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.

Answer: The rules were simple enough to follow ie destroy the enemy base before they destroy yours while upgrading your units or buying new ones along with new heroes. 

* Question: During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

Answer: Yes, in the game you have units that use projectile attacks that go on forever until it hits a foe. I truly believe shorting the range would be better as that seems fair as the AI on some levels spams units whose projectiles can go far and seemingly beat you especially on TRIAL stages which furtherly increases frustration. Also as a pet peeve, you CANNOT get a certain HERO unless you're a Kongregate member. Either way, the player isn't missing out on anything special besides a fast unit. 

* Question: Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?

Answer: Yes and No. In Campaign mode each map ramps up the difficulty slightly however some maps are seemingly impossible which forces the player to farm other maps to obtain more gold to upgrade or get better units. You can stunlock foes if you hit them first and vice versa along with if any unit is attacking during their attack animation and they get hit, they'll stummble and redo their animation again that alone is frustrating especially when the AI stacks ranged units who will constantly stumble your units. According to the update logs updates have been made to where enemy bases aren't as spongey and those gold exploits are now fixed. To help players we get spells to aid us on our quest though you'll only be using 3 out of 12 spells as its a no brainer that Invincibility which makes your units unkillable for a few seconds, BERZERK makes your units CRIT doing more damage, and Comet to save you in a pinch are more useful than the other 9 spells. 

* Question: Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?

Answer: The game was released in 2010 when Kongregate.com had many of its greatest gems released as there was and still is a bunch of variety of games to play so yes the timing was right. 

* Question: During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?

Answer: Absoulutely as the game is called EPIC WAR 4 so you'll be seeing golems, mythical creatures, Gods and other weird and absurd things as well, the music also fits very well. It isn't called EPIC WAR for nothing. 

* Question: Did you have fun playing this game?

Answer: Again absolutely even after all this time the game still holds up 10 years later. Hearing the soundtrack after all this time is the icing on the cake as to me its one of the most memorable things about the game or rather for all EPIC WAR games. 


* Question: During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?

Answer: The game sometimes loses your save file and makes you start all over again even if you're logged into your Kongregate account. This is solved seemingly by logging into your Kongregate Account and if that doesn't work just refresh the page. On most maps whenever you defeat the map ie destroy the enemy base instead of telling you "YOU WIN!" the game just sits there for a few mins and then proceeds to the "YOU WIN!" screen. Welcomed or not I guess after all this time it still hasn't been fixed. Another issue with the game since it came from an earlier time is that when you press retreat or fallback units do not automatically go back they instead finish their attack animation and then fall back which causes the player to lose a majority of their units. Another issue is when any unit dies while attacking they finish their attack animation and then they die so a last stand maybe? To end it all certain units have a blank white box behind them which smears into the background. While it isn't gamebreaking its a reoccuring thing especially for when the player stockpiles their units before sending them out, the same could be said when the AI does it as well.
